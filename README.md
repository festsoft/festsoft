- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @festsoft, based in Durham, UK.
- ğŸ‘€ My main interest is using Yii framework version 2.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on a Yii version of an ophthalmology revision application.
- But there is still a lot I need to learn about the amazing Yii framework!
- ğŸ“« I am retired, with plenty of time available!
- ğŸ“« Reach me at softdev@festsoft.co.uk.
